  <p>The world of sport is continually changing over the years, and the use of technology is just one of those areas that has made an impact on many sports in the modern day. See the annual sports technology awards for the latest technology ideas in the world of sport.

Making changes to a sport, with the inclusion of new technologies, has often caused controversy. One criticism of the use of technology is that it can slow down the speed of the game, but on the other hand for many people it makes watching it more enjoyable to see the correct decisions being made. If a new technology is available, and shown to be accurate, then it should be used so that the correct decisions can be made. It is only fair to the players and teams that the right decisions are made.<!--ref: https://www.topendsports.com/resources/technology.html--></p>

<div class="content1"> <p><u>Brief Overview:</u> <br/>
  Since its appearance, technology has strived to intermingle with almost every area of human life. And even when you thought that was impossible, it did the same with sports. Sports fans were a bit frustrated at first, thinking that tech specialists would interrupt or even slow the game down. The Sports Techie community blog has championed sports tech for the past six years but really going on more than twenty years when you count my career.

The troublesome goals and seemingly equal race times, however, were much more irritating. Hence, sports technology became widely accepted soon after its first appearance. For betting enthusiasts, in particular, it managed to provide indisputable results, without giving them the opportunity to blame it on the betting services, such as NJ Casinos and many more. <!--ref: https://sportstechie.net/a-brief-history-of-technology-in-sports/--></p>

<div class="content2"> <p>In sport, there is a generally accepted rule that the umpire is to blame whenever your favorite team is losing. But, what do you do when there are two? And how about a third, extra umpire?

In cricket, and shortly after in several other sports, there has been an umpire structuring. Two of them are present on the field, actively following the game, each from their own unique viewpoint. When it comes to adjudicating a certain move, these two communicate with each other via a wireless connection. A third, off-court umpire is also used for fuzzier verdicts. This umpire also uses a video replay system which has gained usage in many other crucial sports moments. Since its invention, it has spread to soccer, basketball and many other sports. <!--ref: https://sportstechie.net/a-brief-history-of-technology-in-sports/--></p>

  <div class="content2"> <p> When you think about sports, you think about athletes competing and having fun; they’re playing a game after all.

But really, the game they are playing is a numbers game. Sports are dominated by data and data analytics.

Combine that with ioT (Internet of Things) and you’ve got the tech trend that will dominate sports for the next 10 to 20 years.

On-field cameras and tracking devices embedded into players shoes, helmets, and other gear track players and their statistics in real-time. This allows team coaches and managers to quickly assess undervalued players and dial-in team dynamics that need to be improved.

For instance, Major League Baseball introduced StatCast by rolling out cameras and radar equipment to every team's ballpark for the "gathering and displaying previously immeasurable aspects of the game."

The analysis helps team management pinpoint areas of improvement, award outstanding players, tweak lineups, and more. Once instituted, staff can eventually use the data to create trend-lines and get better at gaming their own success.<!--ref: https://www.idtech.com/blog/how-technology-is-impacting-sports--></p>
