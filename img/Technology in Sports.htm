<div class="content"><h1>The world of sport is continually changing over the years, and the use of technology is just one of those areas that has made an impact on many sports in the modern day. See the annual sports technology awards for the latest technology ideas in the world of sport.

Making changes to a sport, with the inclusion of new technologies, has often caused controversy. One criticism of the use of technology is that it can slow down the speed of the game, but on the other hand for many people it makes watching it more enjoyable to see the correct decisions being made. If a new technology is available, and shown to be accurate, then it should be used so that the correct decisions can be made. It is only fair to the players and teams that the right decisions are made.<!--ref: https://www.topendsports.com/resources/technology.html--></h1>
